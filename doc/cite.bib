    abstract = {Microbial ecology research is currently driven by the continuously decreasing cost of DNA sequencing and the improving accuracy of data analysis methods. One such analysis method is phylogenetic placement, which establishes the phylogenetic identity of the anonymous environmental sequences in a sample by means of a given phylogenetic reference tree. However, assessing the diversity of a sample remains challenging, as traditional methods do not scale well with the increasing data volumes and/or do not leverage the phylogenetic placement information. Here, we present SCRAPP, a highly parallel and scalable tool that uses a molecular species delimitation algorithm to quantify the diversity distribution over the reference phylogeny for a given phylogenetic placement of the sample. SCRAPP employs a novel approach to cluster phylogenetic placements, called placement space clustering, to efficiently perform dimensionality reduction, so as to scale on large data volumes. Furthermore, it utilizes the phylogeny-aware molecular species delimitation method mPTP to quantify diversity. We evaluated SCRAPP using both, simulated and empirical datasets. We use simulated data to verify our approach. Tests on an empirical dataset show that SCRAPP-derived metrics can classify samples by their diversity-correlated features equally well or better than existing, commonly used approaches.

    abstract = "{In recent years, molecular species delimitation has become a routine approach for quantifying and classifying biodiversity. Barcoding methods are of particular importance in large-scale surveys as they promote fast species discovery and biodiversity estimates. Among those, distance-based methods are the most common choice as they scale well with large datasets; however, they are sensitive to similarity threshold parameters and they ignore evolutionary relationships. The recently introduced “Poisson Tree Processes” (PTP) method is a phylogeny-aware approach that does not rely on such thresholds. Yet, two weaknesses of PTP impact its accuracy and practicality when applied to large datasets; it does not account for divergent intraspecific variation and is slow for a large number of sequences.We introduce the multi-rate PTP (mPTP), an improved method that alleviates the theoretical and technical shortcomings of PTP. It incorporates different levels of intraspecific genetic diversity deriving from differences in either the evolutionary history or sampling of each species. Results on empirical data suggest that mPTP is superior to PTP and popular distance-based methods as it, consistently yields more accurate delimitations with respect to the taxonomy (i.e., identifies more taxonomic species, infers species numbers closer to the taxonomy). Moreover, mPTP does not require any similarity threshold as input. The novel dynamic programming algorithm attains a speedup of at least five orders of magnitude compared to PTP, allowing it to delimit species in large (meta-) barcoding data. In addition, Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling provides a comprehensive evaluation of the inferred delimitation in just a few seconds for millions of steps, independently of tree size.mPTP is implemented in C and is available for download at http://github.com/Pas-Kapli/mptp under the GNU Affero 3 license.

They typically use per-gene phylogenies as input, which requires conducting multiple individual tree inferences on a large set of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). At present, no easy-to-use parallel tool for this task exists. Ad hoc scripts for this purpose do not only induce additional implementation overhead, but can also lead to poor resource utilization and long times-to-solution. We present ParGenes, a tool for simultaneously determining the best-fit model and inferring maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenies on thousands of independent MSAs using supercomputers.ParGenes executes common phylogenetic pipeline steps such as model-testing, ML inference(s), bootstrapping and computation of branch support values via a single parallel program invocation.
